# patient-record-organizer-Rust-
Testing out my rust skills by making a record organizer for patients. Considering  that I study bio-med, it makes sense that I link my two passions for something simple but fun.

Current Status:
~ Basic sdd, view, update, delete and list functions works.
~ JSON-based storage is working, but will be replaced with a database in future updates.
~ Unit tests not implemented yet.
~ Date format validation still pending.
~ FHIR integration is planned for future versions.
Note! This is still a work in progress - Any issues? Please report.
Fell free to contribute.
