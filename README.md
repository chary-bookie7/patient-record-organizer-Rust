# patient-record-organizer-Rust-
Testing out my rust skills by making a record organizer for patients. Considering  that I study bio-med, it makes sense that I link my two passions for something simple but fun.

Current Status:

~ Basic add, view, update, delete and list functions works.

~ JSON-based storage is working, but will be replaced with a database in future updates.

~ Unit tests not implemented yet. #Update! I've added units tests.

~ Date format validation still pending.

~ FHIR integration is planned for future versions.

Note! This is still a work in progress - Any issues? Please report.

Fell free to contribute.
